# My First Unity Learning

## Description

This repo is about my learning experience by using this course [Unity Learning](https://learn.unity.com/). The reason i want to learn game development is because i like indie games like [Ori and the Blind Forest](https://www.orithegame.com/), i remember playing it since i was a 9y+ old, It was a thrilling experience.

In this course i've only gotten to unit 2, there's lesson where the lecturer gives walkthrough on the fundamentals, there's challenges where they give us a project where there's problems, bugs that we need to fix.

I think that programming is fun if it's interactive and relatable to people who used it. By this learning experience i hope i can further my self on able making stories being painted into the canvas.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Outline any prerequisites that users need to have installed or set up before they can use your project. This might include Unity version, any external tools, or libraries.

- Unity Hub, amazing management tool for Unity projects and installations and allows you to easily switch between Unity versions and manage your projects.
- Unity Editor, in this case i use Mac M1 Apple Silicon so the only available 2021 version is 2021.3.34f1
- Basic understanding of C#
- IDE, i use VSCode cause it's simple and fast, the extensions i use are [Unity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioToolsForUnity.vstuc), [Unity Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kleber-swf.unity-code-snippets)
- System Requirement, go [here](https://docs.unity.cn/2021.1/Documentation/Manual/system-requirements.html) for more detailed information

### Installation/Setup Project

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install or set up the project. Include commands or links to relevant resources.

1. Install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download), pick one that suits with your OS
2. Open up Unity Hub, then install the version you want, in this case i use the 2021.3.34f1
3. Install IDE, people commonly use Visual Studio but it's based from your preference,
	1. Install .NET, in this case i use `brew` in mac then run `brew install --cask dotnet-sdk`
	2. Install the extensions [Unity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioToolsForUnity.vstuc), [Unity Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kleber-swf.unity-code-snippets)
4. Open Unity Hub > New Project > 3D
5. Follow [Unity Learning](https://learn.unity.com/) course
